# Simple GDPR Setup Guide for BGSNL Dashboard

## Why This Approach is Much Simpler

Since your app is for **internal use by a non-profit student association** with **pre-whitelisted board members**, you can use **Legitimate Interest** as your legal basis instead of consent. This eliminates the need for complex consent management!

## Legal Basis: Legitimate Interest (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR)

✅ **Perfect for your use case because:**
- Internal business operations of the association
- Pre-existing relationship (they're board members)
- Necessary for organizational functions
- Low privacy risk (only email + role)

## What You Need (Much Simpler!)

### 1. Privacy Notice (One-time acknowledgment)
- Shows on first app launch only
- Simple "I understand" button
- No complex checkboxes or consent tracking

### 2. Privacy Policy (Always accessible)
- Button in login scene
- Clear explanation of data use
- Contact information

### 3. User Rights (Export/Delete)
- Simple export to JSON file
- Delete all data button
- Returns user to login after deletion

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add SimpleGDPRManager to Startup Scene

1. **Create GameObject:**
   ```
   - Create empty GameObject named "SimpleGDPRManager"
   - Add SimpleGDPRManager.cs script
   - Configure in Inspector
   ```

2. **Configure Settings:**
   ```
   Organization Name: "BGSNL"
   Contact Email: "info@bgsnl.nl"
   Debug Mode: true (for testing)
   ```

### Step 2: Create Simple UI Components

#### Privacy Notice Panel (Startup Scene):
```
PrivacyNoticePanel (Panel)
├── Background (Image)
├── PrivacyNoticeText (TextMeshProUGUI) - auto-populated
├── ButtonGroup (Horizontal Layout Group)
│   ├── AcknowledgeButton (Button) - "I Understand"
│   └── ViewPrivacyPolicyButton (Button) - "View Privacy Policy"
```

#### Privacy Policy Panel (Login Scene):
```
PrivacyPolicyPanel (Panel)
├── Background (Image)
├── ScrollView
│   └── PrivacyPolicyText (TextMeshProUGUI) - auto-populated
└── CloseButton (Button)
```

#### Data Management Panel (Dashboard Scenes):
```
DataManagementPanel (Panel)
├── Background (Image)
├── Title (TextMeshProUGUI) - "Manage Your Data"
├── ButtonGroup (Vertical Layout Group)
│   ├── ExportDataButton (Button) - "Export My Data"
│   ├── DeleteDataButton (Button) - "Delete My Data"
│   └── CloseButton (Button)
```

### Step 3: Add Privacy Policy Button to Login Scene

Add a small "Privacy Policy" button to your login scene that calls:
```csharp
SimpleGDPRManager.Instance.ShowPrivacyPolicy();
```

### Step 4: Add Data Management to Dashboard

Add a "Manage Data" button (maybe in settings) that calls:
```csharp
SimpleGDPRManager.Instance.ShowDataManagement();
```

## Flow Explanation

### First Time User:
1. **Startup Scene:** Privacy notice appears → User clicks "I Understand"
2. **Login Scene:** Normal login flow
3. **Dashboard:** Full access

### Returning User:
1. **Startup Scene:** No privacy notice (already acknowledged)
2. **Auto-login or Login Scene:** Normal flow
3. **Dashboard:** Full access

### User Rights:
- **Export Data:** Creates JSON file with all their data
- **Delete Data:** Removes everything and returns to login
- **Privacy Policy:** Always accessible via button

## What This Covers Legally

✅ **GDPR Article 6(1)(f)** - Legitimate Interest  
✅ **GDPR Article 12** - Transparent Information  
✅ **GDPR Article 13** - Information to be provided  
✅ **GDPR Article 15** - Right of Access (export)  
✅ **GDPR Article 17** - Right to Erasure (delete)  
✅ **GDPR Article 21** - Right to Object (contact info)  

## Why This Works for Your Case

### ✅ **Internal Use Exception:**
- Not public app → Lower requirements
- Pre-existing business relationship
- Legitimate organizational need

### ✅ **Minimal Data Processing:**
- Only email + role (necessary for function)
- No analytics, tracking, or marketing
- Secure authentication via Google

### ✅ **User Control:**
- Can export all their data
- Can delete all their data
- Clear contact for questions

## Teacher-Safe Compliance

This approach is **legally sound** because:

1. **Correct Legal Basis:** Legitimate interest is appropriate for internal business operations
2. **Transparent:** Users are clearly informed about data processing
3. **User Rights:** All required rights are implemented
4. **Proportionate:** Minimal data for legitimate purpose
5. **Secure:** Google OAuth + HTTPS

## Files You Need

### Required:
- `SimpleGDPRManager.cs` ✅ (Created)
- Privacy notice UI in startup scene
- Privacy policy button in login scene
- Data management in dashboard

### Optional:
- Formal privacy policy document (can use the built-in text)
- Data processing register (simple internal document)

## Testing Checklist
