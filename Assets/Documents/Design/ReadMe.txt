In the folder Screenshots are examples of a figma prototype with the different pages of how I envision the dashboard.

1. Login Page
2. Home Screen with the Dashboard with data for the whole country (BGSNL) 
3. Drop Down menu with option to select between BGSNL- Home Screen/ Main Dashboard, Charts, Cities, Achievements
4. Charts Page - Charts Visualized based on the data
5. Cities Page - Multiple Cities to select from that lead to their dashboard to look at
6. Achievements Page - Achievements showcased

The idea is BGSNL directors to see everything listed from this points but if the user is from a city BGSA for example (Bulgarian Society Amsterdam) to see only the Amsterdam Dashboard and to not be able to see the cities button in the dropdown menu.

Naming convention for the different cities 

Bulgarian Society = BGS
Bulgarian Society Netherlands = BGSNL (this is the mother company overseeing all other cities)
Each other city Amsterdam, Breda, Eindhoven, Maastricht, Groningen, Leeuwarden, we take the first letter and add it to BGS, so Bulgarian Society Amsterdam = BGSA.
